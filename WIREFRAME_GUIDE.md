# üß≠ Annotator Guidelines: Responsive Website Wireframe Sketching

**Goal:**  
You will create **three clean wireframe sketches** (mobile, tablet, and desktop) that accurately represent how an existing webpage‚Äôs layout looks at each device size.

You are **not designing** a layout ‚Äî you are **copying the actual layout structure** shown in the provided screenshots or live webpage, using standard wireframe symbols.

---

## 1. Overview

For each assigned webpage (**Page ID**):
- Create **three sketches** ‚Äî one for each device:
  - üì± **Mobile (‚â§480 px)**
  - üíª **Tablet (‚âà768 px)**
  - üñ• **Desktop (‚â•1200 px)**
- Each sketch should **faithfully reproduce** the layout as it appears in that viewport, focusing on:
  - **Placement and size of elements**
  - **Page hierarchy and spacing**
  - **Responsive changes** (e.g., collapsed menus, stacking, reflow)

---

## 2. What to Copy

- Use the **provided screenshots** (or open the live site and resize your browser to the target width).  
- Pay attention to:
  - Header and navigation (position, visibility, menu style)
  - Image placement and scaling
  - Text block arrangement (columns vs stacked)
  - Sidebars (shown, hidden, or moved)
  - Footer layout
- If an element disappears or changes shape at a smaller size, **show that difference clearly**.

## 3. What to Draw (Wireframe Symbols)

| Type | Symbol |
|------|--------|
| **Image / banner** | Rectangle with an **X** |
| **Text / paragraph** | Wavy lines |
| **Heading / title** | Straight bold line(s) |
| **Button / input box** | Small rectangle with label (e.g., ‚Äúbtn‚Äù) |
| **Navigation bar / menu** | Horizontal bars; collapsed = hamburger icon |
| **Card / grid item** | Box grouping image + lines |
| **Icon** | Small circle or square |
| **List / table** | Repeated horizontal lines |
| **Footer** | Box with wavy lines or icons |

Keep all sketches **monochrome** (black pen/stylus on white background) and **freehand but neat**.
