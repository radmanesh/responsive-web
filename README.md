# LLM Responsive Web Generator and Benchmark Project

## 📋 Overview

This project leverages **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to automatically generate and evaluate responsive web designs across multiple device breakpoints. The project combines **website wireframe annotation**, **LLM-powered generation**, and **benchmarking** to create a comprehensive platform for testing and improving responsive design capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Generate** responsive web wireframes and layouts using LLMs
- **Annotate** existing websites with accurate responsive design patterns
- **Benchmark** LLM performance in understanding and reproducing responsive designs
- **Create datasets** of responsive web layouts across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- **Evaluate** the quality and accuracy of generated responsive designs

## 📱 Supported Device Breakpoints

The project focuses on three primary device sizes:

- **Mobile**: 375 × 688 px (iPhone SE)
- **Tablet**: 768 × 1024 px (iPad Mini)
- **Desktop**: 1280 × 800 px (Responsive Custom)

## 🔑 Key Features

### Wireframe Annotation
- Systematic annotation of webpage layouts at each device breakpoint
- Focus on layout structure, hierarchy, and responsive behavior
- Standardized wireframing symbols and conventions

### LLM Integration
- Utilize LLMs to generate responsive design layouts
- Analyze and understand responsive design patterns
- Predict responsive behavior across breakpoints

### Benchmarking Framework
- Compare LLM-generated designs with ground truth layouts
- Metrics for layout accuracy, element placement, and responsiveness
- Performance evaluation across different device sizes
